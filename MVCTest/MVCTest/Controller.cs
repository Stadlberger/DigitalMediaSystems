    class Controller

    Recieves input from and responds to the view. May query to model to respond
    to search requests issued via the view.  
    NOTE: It may even be desirable to prepare the query results in the controller and
    send ready-made data to the view. This would lead to a complete seperation of
    Accord and Lucene from the View and Form.
